// any actions we want to fire off will go in here; this is where well make all our http requests
//well use axios , there is fetch api or others aswell
//install axios -- well be makign a asynchronouse request --> i.e. to localhost 8000/api/leads
//rsrch this asyncrhonous vs not

//well use dispatch action to reducer; such as getleads --> then the prmisback (.then) will give response
//we want to dispatch get leads action to the reducer so dispatch( pass in object with type); memeber in reducer
//were evaluating a action.type so it fires the return in index.js
//the payload are the leads returned from server (response data from server0 (again closely alinged to reducers/index.js)
//.catch in case theres a error; eventually will make errors reducer that sends to our components

//So how do we actually call this? looking at /api/leads component (the leads tab) -->
// see src/omponents/leads/leads.js; in order to wrk with redux from any component need to use connect
